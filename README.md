Little tricks, solutions by MagosIT Kft - too small to get their own repository

We also host our "stb-like" header-only libraries and single-header libraries here with "UNLICENCE".

## Contents

* log2obj: Script to extract **.obj** data from your console logs for simple point/line-cloud 3D debugging
* stblike: Single-file libraries or single header+impl two-file libraries in the style of "stb"

See each subdirectory for their own README.md descriptions!

## Single-file header only libraries

These are in the `stblike` directory. Filenames usually tell what they are good for.

Some examples:

* prenexlog: Simple and fast logging using macros. Also supports logfiles and redirecting standard i/o.
